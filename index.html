My name is Cade, and I am an aspiring web and app developer, writer, and game/narrative designer, and student of the GIMM program at Boise State University. I am currently a Full Stack Web Developer or Mobile App Developer at GIMM's in house develpment team: GIMM Works, and hope to continue to move upwards from here. It has been my dream for a long time to make a meaningful contribution to a video game that I am passionate about, be it as a writer, narrative designer, or programmer. I am well versed in React and React Native, HTML, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL, and I have experience with Unity and Unreal Engine. I have also been writing for years and am practicing my craft of narrative design to go along with it. I have a huge passion for analyzing games and their connected stories and how complex themes can be portrayed through this underused medium. On this site, you may find a collection of works from myself, including a multitude of games, apps and sites created by me, as well as works of writing I made over the years!</p>

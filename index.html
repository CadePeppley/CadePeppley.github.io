It has been my dream for a long time to make a meaningful contribution to a video game that I am passionate about, be it as a writer, designer, or programmer. I have programming experience in Unity Game Engine with C# among many other languages including Javascript, HTML, CSS, React, and React Native. I have also been writing for years as I am currently pursuing a minor in Creative Writing at Boise State University. In addition, I have a huge passion for analyzing games and their connected stories and how complex themes can be portrayed through this underused medium. On this site, you may find a collection of works from myself, including a multitude of games, apps and sites created by me, as well as works of writing I made over the years!</p>
